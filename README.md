While taking a JavaScript course, we created a website that included three web application pages and a home page for introductory purposes.

The first page is a quiz that tells you what type of traveler you are. After completing the quiz you would receive either Tropical Traveler, Versatile Voyager, or Winter Wanderer. 

For the ETA Master, the user would enter the requested information in each spot, and once submitted, they were given the total travel time for their trip. 

On the Average Meal Cost page, information about popular travel destinations is displayed as well as a column chart showing the average cost of a meal. The chart can be changed to show breakfast, lunch, and dinner prices.
